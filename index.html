        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <p>Throughout this project, I learned valuable lessons in AI and how it can be applied to real-world business cases. One of the most important skills I gained was how to properly prompt AI tools like ChatGPT to maximize their usefulness. I also discovered useful tips and tricks for working with AI tools, which helped me get more out of them. Additionally, I gained a deeper understanding of how tools like ChatGPT function, and I learned about the ethical considerations involved in using AI, such as biases and privacy concerns.</p>
